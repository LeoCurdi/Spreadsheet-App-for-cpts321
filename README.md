StyleCop changes:
- Turned off SA1500 "braces for multi-line statements should not share line". I have been putting opening braces on the same line as the function header since I started coding and I firmly believe that it is better formatting than giving it an entire line.
- Supressed SA1505 "An opening brace should not be followed by a blank line" conflicted with SA1514 "Element documentation header should be preceded by blank line".
